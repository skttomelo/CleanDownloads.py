# CleanDownloads.py
This python script checks the last access times in the downloads folder and moves files that have not been accessed in a set amount of time to an "unused" folder in downloads. Another thing is this python script was written on windows 10, and I am only saying this because some operating systems do not handle the st_atime in the same way.
